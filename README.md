# Pharmacy-Management-Script
The Pharmacy Management System Project In CodeIgniter is primarily concerned with keeping track of and selling pharmacy products. In addition, the system shows all of the categories along with their associated details. Additionally, the system allows for the inclusion of generic names. Admin and Staff Panel are the two sections of the project. The staff account has its own set of limits within the system, according to an overview of this web service. The personnel can only help with the sale item’s upkeep. The user must first enter the customer’s name, then choose the drugs and quantity. The Pharmacy Management Software displays the entire payment amount, prompting the user to enter a paid amount in order to proceed.
